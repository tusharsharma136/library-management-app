# library-management-app
This project was created for our library at IIT Jodhpur. The project code are in a private repository because this application is used in the institute officially. It has all the private keys and paasswords. Here, I have added Snapshots, ReadMe, apk file and a credential for you to login if you install the app. This app aslo had an admin dashboard.
